                            While my journey may not follow a straight path, it has been an
                            adventure filled with twists and turns, ultimately leading me to the

                        <p>
                            In the early days, I immersed myself in the <b>art of graphic design</b>
                            , attending a high school focused on this creative discipline. The
                            allure of visual storytelling captivated me, inspiring dreams of
                            crafting stunning visuals that would captivate audiences. Eager to
                            explore my artistic inclinations further, I pursued studies in sculpture
                            and computer graphics during my college years. However, as fate would
                            have it, I realized that these paths weren't my true calling.

                        <b>web development</b>—an enchanting fusion of artistry and technical
                        wizardry. Intrigued by the power to shape the digital landscape, I decided
                        to redirect my efforts and delve into the realm of web development.

                    <p>
                        With fervor and determination, I embarked on a series of immersive courses
                        and online tutorials. Through these learning experiences, I honed my skills
                        in <b>HTML</b> and <b>CSS</b>, embracing the foundational elements of web
                        design. But my hunger for knowledge didn't stop there. I eagerly delved into
                        the world of <b>JavaScript</b>, captivated by its versatility and the
                        endless possibilities it offered.
